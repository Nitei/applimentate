      "GLUTEN": "Gluten (from Latin gluten, 'glue') is a composite of storage proteins termed prolamins and glutelins[1] that is stored together with starch in the endosperm (which nourishes the embryonic plant during germination) of various cereal (grass) grains. It is found in wheat, barley, rye, [malt] and related species and hybrids (such as spelt, khorasan, emmer, einkorn, triticale, kamut, etc.),[2] as well as products derived from these grains (such as breads and malts). Glutens, and most especially the Triticeae glutens, are appreciated for their viscoelastic properties,[3][4] which give dough its elasticity, helping it rise and keep its shape and often leaving the final product with a chewy texture.
